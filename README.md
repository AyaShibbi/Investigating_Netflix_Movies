# Investigating_Netflix_Movies
This project applies foundational Python skills to explore and analyze Netflix movie data from the 1990s, focusing on data filtering, subsetting, and visualization. By manipulating the dataset, you'll uncover insights for a production company, such as identifying the most common movie durations and counting the number of short action movies from this decade.

# Objective:
- Most Frequent Movie Duration: Identify the most common movie duration among 1990s Netflix movies and save it as an integer value.
- Short Action Movies Count: Determine the number of short (under 90 minutes) action movies released during the 1990s.
- Data Filtering and Subsetting: Apply filtering techniques to focus on movies released between 1990 and 1999 and further subset by genre.

# Project approach:
*1. Filter the Data:*
- Subset the dataset to include only movies released in the 1990s (1990-1999).
*2. Find the Most Frequent Movie Duration:*
- Visualize the distribution of movie durations using a histogram and identify the most frequent duration.
*3. Count Short Action Movies:*
- Filter the dataset to include only action movies and count how many are less than 90 minutes long.

# Skills and Techniques Developed:
- Data Filtering & Subsetting: Improve your ability to filter and subset data using pandas, a fundamental skill in data analysis.
- Data Visualization: Learn to create and interpret visualizations, such as histograms, to explore data distributions.
- Conditional Counting: Practice using Python loops and conditionals to count specific instances within a dataset.
